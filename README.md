# FetchCodingExercise
This iOS app was created by Dominic Cellini and uses the following API: https://themealdb.com/api.php

## Usage
The home page displays all the meals within the "Desserts" category. Clicking on any meal name will bring you to another view, which shows you the name, ingredients, and instructions associated with that meal. The SwiftUI implementation allows you to quickly move back to the home page using the top navigation.
